# Habitable_Worlds

**Discover, analyze, and visualize potentially habitable exoplanets** with cutting-edge ML models, 3D planet renders, and interactive exploration.  

---

## Project Overview

**Habitable Worlds Catalog (HWC)** is a full-stack platform for exploring exoplanets likely to support life, using a **custom, research-grade HWC dataset**.  
The project blends scientific data analysis, ML-powered habitability prediction, and immersive frontend visuals.
The dataset was modified through ML techniques. More info at https://github.com/KhushiRajurkar/Exoplanet-Habitability-Prediction-Model

## Features

- **Planet List & Search**: Instantly browse all known HWC exoplanets, with filters by habitability and texture.
- **Detailed Planet Report**: Click a planet to see mass, radius, temp, orbital period, habitability score, and some fun facts.
- **3D Planet Renderer**: Each world is visualized with a high-quality, realistic texture based on its data.
- **Parameter Plots**: View visual charts for planet features (mass, radius, etc).
- **Interactive UI**: Modern React design with galaxy backgrounds and smooth navigation.
